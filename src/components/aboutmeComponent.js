        I am a full stack developer living in Minneapolis, MN. In a past life, I obtained a finance 
        degree from the U of M Duluth and worked in corporate accounting. When Covid-19 struck, I knew 
        it was time to take my passion for coding to the next level. So, I decided to devote my 
        full attention to learning as many new tools and frameworks as possible in the JavaScript 
        environment.

        I studied very hard and got accepted into the best and most advanced coding program
        that I could find, Codeworks. Even when their US cohort was cancelled due to the virus, I did not
        let that stop me, and I joined the EU remote cohort studying from 2AM - 2PM daily.
